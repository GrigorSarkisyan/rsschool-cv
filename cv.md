## About me

My name is Grigor and I am a candidate for the position of a front-end developer. 
Over the past 10 years, I have worked in my specialty as a Lawyer in various organizations and have achieved great success there. 
The front-end became interested in development when finally came to the conclusion that 
I was ready to change my professional trajectory:<br><br>I want something more global, with a more convenient schedule, with space for self-realization and self-development. I decided to finish the RS school course. As for my personal qualities, they allow me to quickly gain momentum and establish effective activities. I consider myself a very motivated candidate.
